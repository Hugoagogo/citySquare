citySquare

This is my entry for pyweek 2011, more info can be found at http://www.pyweek.org/e/citySquare/

Not much of an actual game at this stage, since you cant actually win yet it is much more of a toy

Click a piece to pick it up
Use the scroll wheel to rotate it to put it down
Click somehwere on the grid or tray to drop the tile

Space bar shuffles the tiles and all the tiles on the grid can be shifted around with the arrow keys

Like i said, you cant actually win yet, or be scored so its kind of just shifting tiles around, have fun.

Requirements
-pyglet

Note resolution and grid size can be easily ajusted at the start of main.py

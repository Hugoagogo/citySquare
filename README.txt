Not much of an actual game at this stage, since you cant actually win yet it is much more of a toy

Click a piece to pick it up
Use the scroll wheel to rotate it to put it down
Click somehwere on the grid or tray to drop the tile

Like i said, you cant actually win yet, or be scored so its kind of just shifting tiles around, have fun.

        <h1>How to play citySquare</h1>
        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>The aim of city square is to match up the tiles from the tray on the right on the grid as best as is possible in a given amount of time</p>
        <p>Points are awarded for COMPLEATED cities (the orange bits i know i need better graphics) and roads. They are however taken away if the city or road is UNCOMPLEATED</p>
        <p>It is also important to note that a one big city will score substantially more than two smaller cities. i.e. a four tile city is worth more than double two, two tile cities</p>
        <p>Also no tile must face off the grid (only grass can touch the edges) and any invalid tile is invisible to the scoring mechanism</p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>The controls are very simple, left-click a tile to pick it up and left-click again either in the grid or tray to place the tile</p>
        <p>Tiles can be rotated by right-clicking them or by using the scroll wheel while you are holding a tile</p>
        <p>All of the tiles currently on the grid can e shifted around using the arrow keys</p>
        <p>To view a breakup of your score so far you can press hold tab</p>
